# Automatic Boat Recognition System

## Project Overview

------ Company aims to leverage deep learning techniques to develop an automatic reporting system capable of recognizing different types of boats. This project focuses on building a robust model that can classify various boat types efficiently and effectively, using transfer learning from a lightweight pre-trained model suitable for deployment on mobile devices.

## Objectives

- **Boat Recognition**: Automatically identify and classify different types of boats from images.
- **Deep Learning Implementation**: Utilize deep learning techniques to build a reliable classification model.
- **Transfer Learning**: Employ a lightweight pre-trained model (such as MobileNetV2) to minimize training time and enhance model performance.
- **Mobile Deployment**: Ensure the model is optimized for deployment on mobile devices, allowing for real-time processing and reporting.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images categorized into the following boat types:
- Buoy
- Cruise Ship
- Ferry Boat
- Freight Boat
- Gondola
- Inflatable Boat
- Kayak
- Paper Boat
- Sailboat


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
